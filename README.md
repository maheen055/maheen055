 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Maheen's Journey</h3></summary>
Hey there! 👋 I'm Maheen Shoaib, a tech enthusiast and Electrical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo 🚀. Proficient in C++, Java, and Python, I love diving into projects that blend theory with hands-on skills. Currently exploring the world of Fusion 360, Altium Designer, and Arduino IDE, I'm on a mission to make tech accessible and exciting.

Interning as a Project Coordinator at Zntel Consulting Inc. honed my skills in project management, VBA scripting, and AutoCAD. Passionate about diversity, I served as the President of the Women in STEM club, sparking engagement and fostering inclusivity.

My GitHub is a mix of projects like the MediEase Medication Dispensing Machine (STM32 microcontroller, PlatformIO) and the Skittle Sorter (C++, Arduino Nano). From coding to volunteering as a Pandemic Volunteer at William Osler Health System, my journey is a fusion of tech, creativity, and community impact.
