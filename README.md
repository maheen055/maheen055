# 👩‍💻 Maheen Shoaib

**`Digital Craftsman (Electrical Engineer/Blogger/Innovator/Full-Stack Developer)`**

Hello there! 👋 I'm Maheen Shoaib, a developer and electrical engineering enthusiast, embarked on a journey to shape the digital landscape. Currently pursuing a BASc. in Electrical Engineering at the University of Waterloo, I'm driven by a passion for constructing comprehensive solutions from concept to implementation 🚀.

My coding endeavors reflect a commitment to precision and innovation. Armed with proficiency in C++, Java, and Python, I build projects that go beyond lines of code, addressing real-world challenges with a hands-on approach. From planning and design to solving complex problems, my projects exemplify a dedication to excellence. Currently exploring the world of Fusion 360, Altium Designer, and Arduino IDE, I'm on a mission to make tech accessible and exciting. Interning as a Project Coordinator at Zntel Consulting Inc. honed my skills in project management, VBA scripting, and AutoCAD. Passionate about diversity, I served as the President of the Women in STEM club, sparking engagement and fostering inclusivity. My GitHub is a mix of projects like the MediEase Medication Dispensing Machine (STM32 microcontroller, PlatformIO) and the Skittle Sorter (C++, Arduino Nano). From coding to volunteering as a Pandemic Volunteer at William Osler Health System, my journey is a fusion of tech, creativity, and community impact.

Let's connect, collaborate, and craft something extraordinary! 🌐✨
